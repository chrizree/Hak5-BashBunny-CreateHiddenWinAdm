# Hak5-BashBunny-CreateHiddenWinAdm

Create a "hidden" local administrator account in Windows (worked with Windows 10 as per Jan 2021 with a local administrator user). This payload is a PoC, there are a lot of delays that can be tweaked or deleted to optimize it all, but... that's up to the user to do ;-)
